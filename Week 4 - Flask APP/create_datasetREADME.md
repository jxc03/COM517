Code breakdown
1. Header comment: 

    ```python
    '''
    This script generates a JSON dataset of 15 users with typical Northern Ireland names and cities.
    Each user has a first and last name, an age between 18 and 55, and a city in Northern Ireland.
    The generated dataset is saved to a file named 'users.json'.
    '''
    ```

2. Import statements:

    ```python
    import json  # Imports the JSON module to work with JSON data
    import random  # Imports the random module to generate random data
    ```

3. Sample data:

    ```python
    # Sample data with typical Northern Ireland names
    first_names = ["Eoin", "Niamh", "Aoife", "Conor", "Siobhan", "Ciaran", "Ciara", "Padraig", "Aine", "Rory", "Orla", "Sean", "Maeve", "Colm", "Aisling"]  # List of first names
    last_names = ["O'Neill", "Gallagher", "Maguire", "Murphy", "O'Donnell", "McLaughlin", "O'Doherty", "Byrne", "Doherty", "McCormack", "Lynch", "McKenna", "Fitzpatrick", "McCarthy", "Campbell"]  # List of last names

    # Sample data with Northern Ireland cities
    cities = ["Belfast", "Derry", "Lisburn", "Newry", "Armagh", "Ballymena", "Bangor", "Coleraine", "Newtownabbey", "Carrickfergus", "Antrim", "Omagh", "Londonderry", "Portadown", "Cookstown"]  # List of cities in Northern Ireland
    ```

4. Generate dataset:

    ```python
    # Generates dataset
    users = []  # Initializes an empty list to store the user data
    for _ in range(15):  # Loop to create 15 users
    user = {  # Dictionary to store the user information
        "name": f"{random.choice(first_names)} {random.choice(last_names)}",  # Randomly chooses a first and last name
        "age": random.randint(18, 55),  # Randomly assigns an age between 18 and 55
        "city": random.choice(cities)  # Randomly chooses a city
    }
    users.append(user)  # Adds the user to the list
    ```

5. Save dataset to JSON file:

    ```python
    # Saves the data to a JSON file
    try:  # Start of the try block for exception handling
        with open('users.json', 'w') as file:  # Opens a file for writing
            json.dump(users, file, indent=4)  # Writes the list of users to the file with an indentation of 4 spaces
        print("JSON dataset created successfully!")  # Prints success message
    except Exception as e:  # Catches any exceptions that occur
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")  # Prints the error message
    ```
Explanation
1. Header comment:
- Provides an overview of what the script does, the structure of the data, and the output.

2. Import statements: 
- `import json`: Brings in the JSON module to handle JSON data operations.
- `import random`: Brings in the random module to generate random values for names, ages, and cities.

3. Sample data:
- `first_names`: A list of typical first names in Northern Ireland.
- `last_names`: A list of typical last names in Northern Ireland.
- `cities`: A list of cities in Northern Ireland where users can be from.

4. Generate dataset:
- Initializes an empty list called `users`.
- Loops 15 times to create 15 user entries.
- `random.choice(first_names)`: Selects a random first name from the list.
- `random.choice(last_names)`: Selects a random last name from the list.
- `random.randint(18, 55)`: Generates a random age between 18 and 55.
- `random.choice(cities)`: Selects a random city from the list.
- Appends each user dictionary to the `users` list.

5. Save dataset to JSON file:
- `try` block: Attempts to write the data to a file and handle any potential errors.
- `with open('users.json', 'w') as file`: Opens (or creates) a file named users.json for writing.
- `json.dump(users, file, indent=4)`: Converts the users list to a JSON-formatted string and writes it to the file with an indentation of 4 spaces for readability.
- `except Exception as e`: Catches any exceptions that might occur during file operations and prints an error message.
